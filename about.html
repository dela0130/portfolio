                <p>Kev D. was born in Ottawa but he grew up in its countryside. Farm fields and forests were his playground. When he started to get older, towns and cities became his focus. By the time he was 18,  he moved to Westboro, Ottawa. After a brief stint in the military, he moved to Montreal in his early 20's. It was here he was introduced to the Montreal tech industry.</p>
                <p>
                    Having reached his 30's, his most recent employment was as a Technical Writer. Here, he began to be interested in design and making an impact. He learned the importance of the design thinking process as a writer. This role showed him that consistent positive outcomes are the result of a quality process.
                </p>
                <p>Presently he is enrolled in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. </p>

                <p>The design process took about a week.  The final few iterations are shown here.</p>
                <p>Other than “d.d”, which is the middle characters of the domain name,  three other elements are symbolic: a taskbar, a pencil, a face.  The blue curved rectangle or taskbar is a symbol of Kev D's preferred medium: technology, computers and the internet. The two smaller elements on the diagonal use closure, a gestalt principle to draw a pencil in your mind. This symbolizes Kev D's ability to write and design.
                </p>
                <p>The two D's and the pencil eraser creates a smiling face. This symbolizes the aim: a positive user experience.
