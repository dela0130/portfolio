Challenges

- Figuring out how to scale the content smoothly with the screen.
    - Maybe I'll use a CSS framework.
    - It looks like just using media queries is FINE, making it move smoothly is a bonus.
- Coding everything - This seems like a big project
    - Maybe I'll code a little at a time.
- Making the circle stroke appear around elements like the nav
- Making the favicon change using media queries for prefers light or dark inside the svg.
    - I am skipping this, since I can't get it to work. You're supposed to be able to make media queries inside the  .svg, but for some reason, it's only picking up the prefers: dark option. Luckily, the favicon I have works well enough in dark or light.
- The original design looks like it has a fixed height for the header. This works fine on the PC, but for mobile, a fixed height for the header element tends to break depending on the device or orientation. 
    - So I'm using media queries to keep it for PC, but not for mobile.
- It was a long process to get the mobile nav setup with it's animations, positioning and extra animated swirl.
- It was a small challenge to get the desktop nav working correctly. Forcing the browser to show what was missing was tough.
