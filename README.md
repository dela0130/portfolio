Challenges

- Figuring out how to scale the content smoothly with the screen.
    - Maybe I'll use a CSS framework.
    - It looks like just using media queries is FINE, making it move smoothly is a bonus.
- Coding everything - This seems like a big project
    - Maybe I'll code a little at a time.
- Making the circle stroke appear around elements like the nav
- Making the favicon change using media queries inside the svg.
    - I am skipping this, since I can't get it to work. You're supposed to be able to make media queries inside the  .svg, but for some reason, it's only picking up the prefers: dark option. Luckily, the favicon I have works well enough in dark or light.
