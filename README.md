Wow, can't believe you made it here to read this! Thanks for digging this far.

## Reflection on coding my portfolio

I began designing this portfolio for my midterm in User Experience Design course at Algonquin College, around February, 2022. Then for my final Web Development project, I began coding it in April 2022. It was a great experience to bring something I designed to life. Over all, I've learned that coding a website from scratch is a huge, inefficient endevour. Having to program each element manually is very time consuming. I'm very happy to have submitted this assignment.

One of the main challenges was creating the animated swirl in the mobile menu. During the design stage, I had this design in mind. It took a lot of Googling and experimentation be able to get that effect animated correctly. Then, remembering how position: absolute worked was another matter.

Another challenge I overcame for this project was dealing with CSS Flexbox. Even after two semesters, I still find it a bit unintuitive. I feel like a lot of trial and error went into coding something I prefer. I even resorted to CSS Grid once, which turned out to be far easier for what I was trying to do. Overall, I think the result was fairly good. I managed to use flex-basis to my benefit this time, so I consider that a success.

The biggest challenge was the days upon days of coding to get the result that I wanted. It was like a full time, unpaid job for almost seven days straight. I have had some difficulty with overworking myself, so this time I think I did a good job pacing myself. I think it's important to live, even when you're trying to complete finals. So I did at least spend some nights gaming or watching TV with my wife. Long story short, I think I was fairly balanced.

## Thanks

I'd like to thank my classmate Zarina Laalo for always being a great sounding board throughout the semester. I'd also like to thank Adam Jarvis for being my favourite  web dev prof. two semesters running. Hopefully we run into each other next semester!
